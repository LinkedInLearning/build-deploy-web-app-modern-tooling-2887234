Most web developers today do their work supported by a variety of tools: IDEs, code repositories, test systems, and more. However, most people don't get to use those tools when they’re just starting out on their web developer training, and generally get introduced to them as parts, without seeing how they fit together. In this project-based course, Oluchi Okpala presents a simple example developers can easily follow while seeing how the tools fit together around it. If you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but want to learn more about how they all work together to create today’s dynamic and interactive content, this course is for you.
