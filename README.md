JavaScript is the most popular programming language used by professional developers today according to Stackoverflow.com; It's experiencing unprecedented growth in demand to the point that even back-end developers choose JavaScript more often than not.

It is without question, the default language of the internet. Since browsers are a necessary part of any user’s online experience, it’s easy to see why JavaScript is so significant because in order to build a web app, you must use javascript.

Since it’s already installed on every web browser today, you can just jump in and start coding right there on the browser. It's also very easy to search for Javascript related stuffs because there is a large online community that offers support and advice and an excellent tool for beginning programmers who want to expand their skill set into other languages as well.

Given the increasing number of businesses and companies being birthed every day, there is a corresponding increase in demand for developers who are familiar with Javascript programming especially on the frontend. According to a report released by Devskiller.com, 70 percent of companies surveyed want to hire a JavaScript developer.
